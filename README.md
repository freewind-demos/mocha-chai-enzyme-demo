Moch Chai Enzyme Shallow Demo
==============================

Enzyme `shallow()` demo with mocha.

It's for unit-testing the component only.

```
npm test
```

Notice
------

If the component contains inner components, also `.html()` will show 
all rendered html, but the wrapper can't find or interact with inner
 components.
